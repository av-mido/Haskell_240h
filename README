240h Fall 2011 (I'm not really enrolled)
Alex Vasilyev


how to run: 
1) ghc --make Main.hs
2) a) echo The angry dog jumped over the lazy fox | Main.exe
   or
   b) Main.exe Macbeth.txt
   
Alternatively, cabal works too.

TODO: This still can't handle multiple files; a max of one file can be specified with a command line argument.
      ...I probably won't end up fixing this.
